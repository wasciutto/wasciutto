title: Introduction to Blue Dusk
---

Today is the first day of my learning technology blog! It doesn't even have a real name yet. I just know that I want a place to discuss my interest in learning technology, especially adaptive/intelligent tutoring, and have a place to put everything.

I think it's apt to start with a little description of who I am, what I've done, and where I'd like to be heading. First off, I am a big learner myself. I've loved knowledge since I was a kid, and loved to read books of knowledge and facts. I especially loved books on the natural world, and later on history. Going into college I was a bit scattered, but eventually took a Computer Science I class during my junior year after (like most) I had tried to develop my own game. I fell in love immediately and switched my major.

My first job as an application security analyst at a large bank wasn't really for me, but it taught me how large companies work and, more importantly, how to deal with data. I jumped on an opportunity to join a data science consulting firm as a data engineer, where I got a lot of experience in a short amount of time. My goal was to get closer to machine learning, which had always interested me but not been something I had been able to broach in undergrad. Working closely with data scientists to meet their needs gave me lots of on the job experience in this field, but I still wasn't getting quite the engagement with machine learning that I wanted.

Like many people who love knowledge, I was drawn to academia, specifically the psychology of learning. I was also hoping to find a way to learn more about machine learning and analytics without having to go into debt over an expensive master's. I got an opportunity to work with psychology research labs at UNC as a scientific programmer, specifically in the field of transforming fMRI data for analysis. In this role I got to spend more time with hands-on data analysis, needing to learn a lot more in this area to meet the needs to graduate researchers. Specifically I had to learn a lot of matrix-algebra driven statistical theory needed to reduce the noise in the huge datasets I was dealing with, and also the parameters of the GLM models that were used to pull out the signals of interest. 

After 3 years in this role, I decided to take a working hiatus to travel the country and take time to assess the arc of my career. In crossing New Mexico, Arizona, California, Utah, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington, I got the chance to prototype some of the adaptive tutoring tools I will be expanding on in the coming months.

I have a ton of relatively scattered ideas in this space, and my hope is that with Project Blue Dusk I can unify these into a cohesive framework. With such a structure I have a better chance of keeping the project going when things get inevitably get busier with work and life.
