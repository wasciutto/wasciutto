title: Early Modeling Experimentation

After .fit() vs .predict() strikes again, I managed to get the same heat map out for my new digit splitting model.

This is very, very cool. The boundaries between 10s values are very clear here.

With values plotted:

I have cut out the 100 value because there is a bit of weirdness going on there. I think this model would be best treated as a two digit system.

Facinatingly, it follows the general trend of the prior heatmap:

The extra dimension allows the model to drill down on the differences between how digits impact things.
